<p><a href="http://is.gd/S4xPun">This piece</a> from the New York Times touches on a subject that I'm passionate about - the challenges of hiring good people.  Deep into it, it mentions that:</p>
<blockquote><p>"...the most proven method, Dr. Lewin said, is a referral from someone already working there. Current employees know the culture, he said, and have their reputations and their work environment on the line."
</p></blockquote>
<p>The big data thing is a cool, tech solution, but really it's referrals that matter.</p>
