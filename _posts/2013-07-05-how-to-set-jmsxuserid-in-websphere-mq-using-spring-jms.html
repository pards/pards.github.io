<p>Every time I work with MQ and Spring JMS I want to poke my eyes out with a dull instrument.  It's always a pain in the neck.  My most recent challenge was trying to get the JMSXUserID field to flow through to the application on the other side of MQ.</p>
<p>First, I created a MessagePostProcessor to add the JMS header<br />
[java]<br />
public class MyMessagePostProcessor implements MessagePostProcessor<br />
{<br />
	private String userId;</p>
<p>	@Override<br />
	public Message postProcessMessage(Message msg) throws JMSException<br />
	{<br />
		msg.setStringProperty(JmsConstants.JMS_IBM_MQMD_USERIDENTIFIER, userId);<br />
		msg.setStringProperty(&quot;JMSXUserID&quot;, userId);<br />
		return msg;<br />
	}<br />
}<br />
[/java]</p>
<p>But when I checked the queue with HermesJMS I could see that the JMSXUserID had been overwritten somewhere, so I fired up WireShark and watched for the message and confirmed that the message that was going over the wire already had the JMSXUserID field overwritten.  This was a good thing - the issue was in the IBM MQ JMS client code.</p>
<p>Everywhere I looked online told me that the JMSXUserID field is set by the JMS provider in the 'send' method, and that there was little or no possibility of controlling it.  Then I found <a href="http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r0/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.mq.csqzaw.doc%2Fjm41030_.htm">this reference</a> on the IBM site that said:</p>
<blockquote><p>
You must set the Destination object property WMQ_MQMD_WRITE_ENABLED to true for the setting of MQMD properties to have any effect<br />
...<br />
It is necessary to set WMQ_MQMD_MESSAGE_CONTEXT before setting JMS_IBM_MQMD_UserIdentifier.
</p></blockquote>
<p>However, these are properties of the Destination, to which I did not currently have access because I was using Spring's JmsTemplate + DynamicDestinationResolver to send the message.  So I extended Spring's DynamicDestinationResolver, set the two fields I needed to and Voila! The JMSXUserID passed through.</p>
<p>[java]<br />
public class MqDestinationResolver extends DynamicDestinationResolver<br />
{<br />
	@Override<br />
	public Destination resolveDestinationName(Session session, String destinationName, boolean pubSubDomain) throws JMSException<br />
	{<br />
		MQDestination mqDest = (MQDestination)super.resolveDestinationName(session, destinationName, pubSubDomain);<br />
		mqDest.setBooleanProperty(WMQConstants.WMQ_MQMD_WRITE_ENABLED, true);<br />
		mqDest.setIntProperty(WMQConstants.WMQ_MQMD_MESSAGE_CONTEXT, WMQConstants.WMQ_MDCTX_SET_IDENTITY_CONTEXT);<br />
		return dest;<br />
	}<br />
}<br />
[/java]</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
