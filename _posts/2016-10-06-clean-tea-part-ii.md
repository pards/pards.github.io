This is a continuation of my post about [clean tea](/2016/09/clean-tea), except this time I analysed the offerings from [Teavana®](http://www.teavana.com) (a Starbucks company).

Teavana® by the numbers:

* 101 teas (excluding kits and samplers)
* 70 contain sugar and/or flavourings
* 31 caffeine-free
* 4 had no ingredients listed

So I filtered the list to only show teas with:

* No caffeine
* No sugar
* No flavourings

Only one tea on the Teavana® menu passes my filter for what I would consider to be "clean".  It is ... (drum roll) ...

* [Mint Majesty® herbal tea](http://www.teavana.com/us/en/tea/herbal-tea/mint-majesty-herbal-tea-32349.html)

Full disclosure: Not all products on the Teavana® website showed the ingredients and caffeine levels.  [Lemon Ginger](http://www.teavana.com/us/en/tea/herbal-tea/lemon-ginger-herbal-tea-32770.html) and [Chamomile Bloom](http://www.teavana.com/us/en/tea/herbal-tea/chamomile-bloom-herbal-tea-32735.html), for example, are both probably caffeine-free but it isn't explicitly stated on the website. Nor are their ingredients listed so I cannot determine whether they contain added flavourings or sweeteners.
