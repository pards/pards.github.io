After a decade of abuse I've decided to ditch my Bell landline in favour of
VOIP.

My last Bell bill was $60.26 for a basic phone with 2 features.

I did a lot of research into the various providers in Canada. My short list of
potentials was

  * [Vonage](http://Vonage.ca) \- the biggest player
  * [voip.ms](http://voip.ms) \- the cheapest player
  * [AcroVoice](http://acrovoice.ca)
  * [Cogeco](http://www.cogeco.ca)

In the end I went for AcroVoice because they seem to have the best mix of
service, simplicity and professionalism. Their basic service is only
$10.95/month and they provide pre-configured hardware at a reasonable cost.

I'm a little nervous about the switch process because I'll be porting my old
number. I don't want any downtime on the line, and I don't want my DSL service
to get disconnected when Bell disconnects my landline. I'll report back in a
week or so.

**Update 7 March 2011**  
My DSL internet service is provided by [Sentex](http://sentex.ca). When I
called them to notify them of the DRY loop change (DSL, no phone line) they
informed me that they would charge me $65.99 in fees, not the $15.99
advertised on their website, plus an extra $9.50/month. I'm feeling a little
bit screwed right now but it's too late to back out.

**Update 15 March 2011**  
The cutover went fine and the new phone line is working well.  
However, I neglected to consider that our remotely monitored alarm system also
uses the phone line and this is now not functioning. [My alarm
company](http://www.protectron.com/) is offering a cellular-based solution for
an extra $10/mth plus $299 for the connector but it isn't very appealing given
the higher DSL costs I'm already shouldering. There might be a way that I can
jerry-rig the VOIP line to work with the alarm system, but I might be better
off just buying out the monitoring contract and switching to [an alarm company
that supports VOIP](http://nextalarm.com/).
