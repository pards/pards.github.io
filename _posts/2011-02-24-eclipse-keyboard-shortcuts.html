<p>When I first started working at Intelliware I was amazed at how efficient the developers were while working in Eclipse.  Most of this efficiency and speed came from a deep knowledge of Eclipse's keyboard shortcuts.</p>
<p><!--more-->Here is my list of Eclipse keyboard shortcuts that every developer should know.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Ctrl-Shift-L</strong>: Show list of shortcuts</li>
<li><strong>Ctrl-K</strong>: Find next</li>
<li><strong>Ctrl-Shift-R</strong>: Open a file in your workspace. It supports CamelCase shorthand too, so "SBFil" will find "SomeBigFile.java" and "SBFile.java"</li>
<li><strong>Ctrl-Shift-G</strong>: Find references for a class or method. Want to find who calls MyClass.getName()? Put your cursor on the getName() definition and hit Ctrl-Shift-G</li>
<li><strong>F3</strong>: Drill into a method. This will jump from the code that calls the method into the method definition. Similar to holding Ctrl and clicking on the method call.</li>
<li><strong>Ctrl-T</strong>: Open implementors of an interface. Very useful when using F3 to follow the flow of method calls.</li>
<li><strong>Ctrl-O</strong>: Open a list of method declarations in the current class. Allows you to jump directly to the method using the arrow keys and enter. <strong>Bonus points</strong>: typing Ctrl-O again while the list is showing will also list method declarations from all superclasses</li>
<li><strong>Ctrl-E</strong>: Shows a list that allows you to switch between open files</li>
<li><strong>Alt-Shift-W</strong>: Locates the current file in the Navigation or Package Explorer tree.</li>
<li><strong>Ctrl-L</strong>: Go to line number. You might want to show line numbers by default by changing the preference General&gt;Editors&gt;Text Editors</li>
<li><strong>Ctrl-H</strong>: Find a string in all files. You can customize this to only show the File search by clicking the Customize button and unchecking the other options</li>
<li><strong>Ctrl-Shift-O</strong>: Organize import statements. This also removes any unused imports.</li>
<li><strong>Ctrl-Shift-F</strong>: Reformat the file</li>
</ol>
<p>You should also familiarize yourself with the following debugging shortcuts</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>F5</strong>: Step into</li>
<li><strong>F6</strong>: Step over</li>
<li><strong>F7</strong>: Step back out</li>
<li><strong>F8</strong>: Resume (i.e. continue to next breakpoint)</li>
<li><strong>Ctrl-Shift-I</strong>: Show current value of variable</li>
<li><strong>Ctrl-R</strong>: Run to current line</li>
</ol>
