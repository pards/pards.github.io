I read a great quote in [I'm feeling lucky](http://www.amazon.com/Im-Feeling-
Lucky-Confessions-Employee/dp/0547416997). It described a note sent from one
Google employee to another as he handed over a piece of software.

  * Here's what I've done.
  * Here's how it's running.
  * Here are some things to look at.
  * Here's what's going to go wrong if it goes wrong.
  * Here are the steps to turn it off.

These five points would be invaluable documentation to any new code or
functionality. Imagine how much time could be saved if you had this
information before embarking upon a code change.
