<p>For the last 2 months, we've been using <a title="ControlTier" href="http://controltier.org">ControlTier</a> to automate deployments to our integration and QA environments.  Our deployment is a little more complicated that most Java applications because it runs on a pseudo-grid.  That is, there are 2 clustered JBoss servers, a database server, and 4+ Linux servers that each run about 8 Java processes.</p>
<p>I was able to get ControlTier up and running in a few days, and defining the jobs was relatively straightforward.</p>
<p>Features I really like include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tagging nodes. This allows me to run, for example, the JBoss startup on all nodes tagged as "jboss".  If I add a new node I don't have to modify the job.</li>
<li>Composite jobs. I can define small, single-purpose jobs and combine them into larger jobs. Code re-use, if you will.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are a few features I'd really like to see:</p>
<ol>
<li>A Jenkins plug-in.  Deployments to the Integration environment always follow a successful build.</li>
<li>Simpler parallel job configuration. I can start all Java grid processes simultaneously, but haven't figured out how to get ControlTier to do it.</li>
<li>Ability to configure environments and run the same job against multiple environments rather than having to copy the job and change its project or target nodes.</li>
<li>Synchronous job execution. Although this may not be necessary if there was a Jenkins plug-in.</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall I'm happy with what <a title="ControlTier" href="http://controltier.org">ControlTier</a> is doing for us.  If I get time, I'd also like to compare it to other deployment frameworks like <a title="RunDeck" href="http://rundeck.org">RunDeck</a>.</p>
