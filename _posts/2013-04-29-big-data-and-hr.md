[This piece](http://is.gd/S4xPun) from the New York Times touches on a subject
that I'm passionate about - the challenges of hiring good people. Deep into
it, it mentions that:

> "...the most proven method, Dr. Lewin said, is a referral from someone
already working there. Current employees know the culture, he said, and have
their reputations and their work environment on the line."

The big data thing is a cool, tech solution, but really it's referrals that
matter.
