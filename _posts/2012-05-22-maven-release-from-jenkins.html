<p>I encountered this error while setting up a Jenkins job to automate our Maven release process.</p>
<p><code>[INFO] EXECUTING: cmd.exe /X /C "hg commit --message "[maven-release-plugin] prepare for next development iteration" c:\jenkins\jobs\Release\workspace\pom.xml"<br />
[DEBUG] abort: C:\Jenkins\jobs\Release\workspace\pom.xml not under root<br />
[ERROR]<br />
EXECUTION FAILED<br />
  Execution of cmd : commit failed with exit code: -1.<br />
  Working directory was:<br />
    c:\jenkins\jobs\Release\workspace<br />
  Your Hg installation seems to be valid and complete.<br />
    Hg version: 2.0 (OK)<br />
</code></p>
<p>Our Jenkins box runs on Windows.  It turns out the Mercurial (HG) is case-sensitive in a way that hadn't impacted our project in any way up until this point.  Note the subtle differences in the first two log statements:</p>
<p><code>c:\jenkins<br />
C:\Jenkins<br />
</code></p>
<p>This was because our JENKINS_HOME environment variable was set to "c:\jenkins" but HG was using "C:\Jenkins".  </p>
<p>The solution was to change the value of the JENKINS_HOME environment variable to the case-sensitive "C:\Jenkins", restart the service, and everything worked fine.</p>
