When I first heard about the so-called UK Challenger Banks like [Monzo](https://monzo.com/) and [Atom](https://www.atombank.co.uk/), I was amazed that there wasn't a similar offering in Canada.  The Canadian retail banking sector desperately needs new players bring compelling products to the market but nobody was doing it. There are some options like [PC Financial](https://www.pcfinancial.ca/) and [Tangerine](http://tangerine.ca) but they're both backed by one of the Big Banks (CIBC and Scotiabank, respectively).  Nobody was attempting a ground-up rebuild of a bank using modern technology and practices.

And then I heard about [KOHO](https://www.koho.ca/) and their pre-paid Visa card backed by [People's Trust](http://www.peoplestrust.com/en/).

KOHO built their tech new from the ground-up. It has a mobile-first user interface hooked up to a modern real-time server written in Go.

This is banking, re-imagined. No legacy infrastructure. No suffocating bureaucracy.

The product has some killer features, too:

- No fees
- 0.5% cashback rewards
- Real-time transaction notifications
- Savings "buckets" to save for specific goals
- Spendable amount (prevents spending your goal money)
- Lost your card? Lock it. Found it again? Unlock it. No need to cancel the card!
- Only 1.5% margin on Foreign Exchange. Most cards charge 2.5% or more.

The benefits of a real-time system are evident when you top it up. Email transfers come through in a matter of minutes, and transaction notifications in the app happen _at the same time_ as the "approved" screen on the point-of-sale system.
