Today is my last day at CIBC and that makes me sad. It's been an honour and a
privilege to work with [Mike Salvagna](http://ca.linkedin.com/pub/michael-salvagna/0/a26/a8a) 
and his fantastic development team for the last 18 months.
Mike has assembled one of the best development teams in Toronto that, in his
words, "can build anything". I believe he's right.

Tomorrow I start at [Intelliware](http://intelliware.com) where I'll be
leading another FX project. I'm looking forward to the challenges that this
new position will bring, but I can't help feeling down about leaving behind
such a great team at CIBC.
