<p>I recently set up a Mercurial server (Windows, Apache, ActiveDirectory and hgweb.wsgi).  However, cloning our 1Gb repository took an hour or more and often failed.</p>
<p>The only information in the Apache log was<br />
[java]<br />
mod_wsgi (pid=1234: Exception occurred processing WSGI script 'C:/hg/hgweb/hgweb.wsgi'<br />
IOError: failed to write data<br />
[/java]</p>
<p>The solution was to disable compression by adding the following lines to hgweb.config<br />
[java]<br />
[server]<br />
preferuncompressed = true<br />
[/java]</p>
<p>By default, Mercurial will compress everything before sending it down the pipe.  This makes sense if you have a powerful server and a slow network, but the opposite was true for us - Mercurial's hosted on an old dual-core Windows VM connected to a 1Gb corporate LAN.</p>
<p>Cloning takes under 5 mintues after the configuration change.</p>
