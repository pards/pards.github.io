Many large companies have explicit policies around which development tools to
use. For example, "Here at Really Big Corporation we use CVS, Ant and
Eclipse". I understand that companies need to limit the proliferation of tools
to ensure familiarity and supportability, but sometimes a little flexibility
would be nice.

When I hire a tradesman to do work on my house I don't tell him that we use
handsaws here, not tablesaws. I trust him to use the tools that make him the
most productive.
