This is a quick cheat sheet taken from a great little book called ["The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing"][1] by Al Ries & Jack Trout. I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in marketing ... even developers!

*The Law of Leadership*  
It's better to be first than it is to be better.

*The Law of the Category*  
If you can't be first in a category, set up a new category you can be first in.

*The Law of the Mind*  
It's better to be first in the mind than to be first in the marketplace.

*The Law of Perception*  
Marketing is not a battle of products, it's a battle of perceptions.

*The Law of Focus*  
The most powerful concept in marketing is owning a word in the prospect's mind.

*The Law of Exclusivity*  
Two companies cannot own the same word in the prospect's mind.

*The Law of the Ladder*  
The strategy to use depends on which run you occupy on the ladder. If you're 2nd, then acknowledge it and market as an alternateive.

*The Law of Duality*  
In the long run, every market becomes a two-horse race.

*The Law of the Opposite*  
If you're shooting for second place, your strategy is determined by the leader. Discover the essence of the leader and then present the prospect with the opposite.

*The Law of Division*  
Over time, a category will divide and become two or more categories. Corollory: Categories don't combine, only divide.

*The Law of Perspective*  
Marketing effects take place over an extended period of time.

*The Law of Line Extension*  
There's an irresitible pressure to extend the equity of the brand. In the long run and in the presence of serious competition, line extensions almost never work.

*The Law of Sacrifice*  
You have to give up something in order to get something. There are three things to sacrifice: product line, target market, or constant change.

*The Law of Attributes*  
For every attribute, there is an opposite, effective attribute.

*The Law of Candor*  
When you admit a negative, the prospect will give you a positive.

*The Law of Singularity*  
In each situation, only one move will produce substantial results. History teaches that the only thing that works in marketing is the single, bold stroke.

*The Law of Unpredictability*  
Unless you write your competitors' plans, you can't predict the future. Marketing plans based on what will happen in the future are usually wrong.

*The Law of Success*  
Success often leads to arrogance, and arrogance leads to failure

*The Law of Failure*  
Failure is to be expected and accepted. Recognize failure early and cut your losses.

*The Law of Hype*  
The situation is often the opposite of the way it appears in the press.

*The Law of Acceleration*  
Successful programs are not build on fads, they're built on trends.

*The Law of Resources*  
Without adequate funding an idea won't get off the ground.
