<p>I attended a talk at the Toronto Agile Tour on Deliberate Practice that focused on TDD Games and other programming challenges like Kata.  Among the challenges were things like solving a problem without using the 'if' keyword, or without using primitives.</p>
<p>Solving simple problems using these challenges makes us better programmers because they force us to come up with multiple, creative solutions to the same problem.</p>
<p>Here's my solution for how to divide without using the division operator ("/") in Java. The method should take a numerator and a denominator and return the largest integer multiplier. For example 10/3 = 3, which would be called as int result = divide(10, 3)</p>
<pre name="code" class="java">
public interface DivisionOperator {
  int divide(int numerator, int denominator);
}
</pre>
<pre name="code" class="java">
/** ************************************* */
public class Division implements DivisionOperator {
  public int divide(int numerator, int denominator) {
    if( denominator == 0){
      throw new IllegalArgumentException("Denonimnator cannot be zero");
    }
    int i = 1;
    while( denominator * i &lt;= numerator){
      i++;
    }
    return i - 1;
  }
}
</pre>
<pre name="code" class="java">
/** ************************************* */
public class DivisionTest {
  @Test
  public void testDivision() {
    checkDivisionOperatorImplementation(new Division());
    checkDivisionOperatorImplementation(new DivisionAlternateAnswer());
  }

  private void checkDivisionOperatorImplementation( DivisionOperator div){
    try {
      div.divide(0, 0);
      Assert.fail("Expected divide by zero error");
    } catch (Exception e) {
      // Expected
    }
    Assert.assertEquals( 0, div.divide(0, 10));
    Assert.assertEquals( 3, div.divide(10, 3));
    Assert.assertEquals( 0, div.divide(3, 10));
    Assert.assertEquals( 1, div.divide(3, 3));
  }
}
</pre>
<p>I came up with a few implementations (hence the interface, makes testing much easier) but I think this one is the cleanest. I'm pretty sure there's a solution using bit shifting but let's face it, most developers don't use bit shifting in their code.</p>
