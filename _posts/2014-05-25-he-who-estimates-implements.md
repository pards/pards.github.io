Well, that's great. Can I presume that you're one of the two developers
working on it? I didn't think so.

Nothing irks me more than being handed a batch of work along with the timeline
for delivering it. If you want to estimate my work for me, then you can also
go ahead and build it.

To be clear, I'm not talking about Planning Estimates, I'm talking about hard
deadlines. I use Planning Estimates to attach a high-level cost to a feature
which helps customers prioritize the work. However, once the work is scheduled
the actual developers building the feature re-estimate it in detail and this
is communicated to the customer along with the expected delivery date.

The variables for any given chunk of work are:

  * Scope
  * Resources
  * Timeline

You can only control 2 of these.

Tell me what to build. I'll tell you how much effort it'll take. You can
adjust the timeline by either reducing scope or adding people (up to a point.
9 women can't have a baby in 1 month).

Just don't try to control all three.
