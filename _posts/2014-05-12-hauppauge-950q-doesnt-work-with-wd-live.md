title: Hauppauge 950Q doesn't work with WD Live

According to the Hauppauge website, the Western Digital Live Hub works with
the Hauppauge WinTV-HVR-950Q TV tuner.

It does not.

The Hauppauge app does the channel scan, but freezes when you try to change
channels. In other words you have to reboot the WD Live box whenever you want
to change channels. That doesn't count as working in my books. Just sayin'...

A bit of Googling has shown that 950Q hardware Rev B may have worked, but the
version commonly available in stores is Rev E. YMMV.
