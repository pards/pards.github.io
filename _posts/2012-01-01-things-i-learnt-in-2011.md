  1. Automation is good.
  2. People make or break a project. ThanksÂ [Joel](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/GuerrillaInterviewing3.html).
  3. Coding the right tests is hard, but infinitely valuable.
  4. "Cutting edge development" describes the processes and principles, not the technologies.
  5. Software must be tested in a representative environment.
  6. Knowing the gaps between marketing and reality in your vendor's software is valuable.
  7. The timing of a discussion directly influences its outcome.
  8. Metrics are useful but can be gamed.
