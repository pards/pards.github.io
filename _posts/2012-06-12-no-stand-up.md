There was no stand-up this morning and it felt like my day never really
started. It was my first day at my new job with CIBC and, even though I knew
that the team was not agile before signing up for the gig, I had
underestimated how much I depended upon our daily <del>rituals</del> practices
at Intelliware. These practices provided a rhythm and cadence to the day that
I had taken for granted.
