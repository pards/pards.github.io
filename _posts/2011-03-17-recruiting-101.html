<p>Recruiting is difficult. Most of the top talent already have jobs and are rarely in the job market. As a recruiter (or a headhunter, or a talent scout) these are precisely the people that you should be trying to attract.</p>
<p><!--more-->There are a few simple guidelines that might help you generate genuine interest in the role you're trying to fill.</p>
<ol>
<li>Try to build relationships with candidates, not just a contact database. I need to know that you are someone I can work with and can be trusted to be discrete. Let's have lunch together.</li>
<li>Proof-read your email.</li>
<li>Give me a detailed description of the role including the actual company name and location. Leave out the technology buzzwords - truly great developers can operate effectively in any landscape</li>
<li>Do not ask me to send you "an updated copy of your resume in MS Word format".  I don't know who you are or what you're going to do with it; what happens if you unknowingly send my resume to my current employer?</li>
<li>Be discrete. Don't call me on my work phone. When you call my cell phone always ask first if it is OK to talk <em>and listen to my answer</em>. If I say no then just say, "OK, let's talk later" and hang up.</li>
</ol>
<p>Following these simple rules will dramatically increase the quality of your candidates and get a higher response rate to your communications. Who knows, you might even make more money because you'll be able to consistently deliver the candidates that nobody else can find.</p>
