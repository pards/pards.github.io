<p>Many large companies have explicit policies around which development tools to use. For example, "Here at Really Big Corporation we use CVS, Ant and Eclipse". I understand that companies need to limit the proliferation of tools to ensure familiarity and supportability, but sometimes a little flexibility would be nice.</p>
<p>When I hire a tradesman to do work on my house I don't tell him that we use handsaws here, not tablesaws. I trust him to use the tools that make him the most productive.</p>
