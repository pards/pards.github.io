<p>I read a great quote in <a title="I'm Feeling Lucky" href="http://www.amazon.com/Im-Feeling-Lucky-Confessions-Employee/dp/0547416997">I'm feeling lucky</a>. It described a note sent from one Google employee to another as he handed over a piece of software.</p>
<ul>
<li>Here's what I've done.</li>
<li>Here's how it's running.</li>
<li>Here are some things to look at.</li>
<li>Here's what's going to go wrong if it goes wrong.</li>
<li>Here are the steps to turn it off.</li>
</ul>
<p>These five points would be invaluable documentation to any new code or functionality. Imagine how much time could be saved if you had this information before embarking upon a code change.</p>
