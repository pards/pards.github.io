> When changing your password, please remember that it must be between 5 and 8
characters in length and should contain both letters and numbers. Special
characters (e.g. #, &, @) must not be used as they will not be accepted by the
system. Passwords consisting of all letters or all numbers are not
recommended. Although TD Canada Trust does not require you to change your
password, we recommend that for security purposes you change your password
every 90 days.

I find this password policy ridiculous for a bank.

  * No special characters?
  * Only 8 characters maximum?

It's almost like TD wants my account to get hacked.
