<p>A few months ago I bought an HTC Desire from Telus.  While I loved the phone, it had problems from the beginning.  The keyboard would regularly freeze mid-email/sms and the only way to revive the device was to pull out the battery and restart the phone.</p>
<p><!--more-->It would often reboot when an incoming call was ringing.  This is a major failure for a phone - at the very least it should be able to accept phone calls.</p>
<p>Anyway, I returned it to Telus who sent it back to HTC for repair.  I was "given" (for $150 deposit) an old HTC Hero running Android 1.5 as a loaner phone to use until my Desire was fixed.</p>
<p>The Hero was rock-solid on 1.5. No issues at all - apart from the lack of tethering.</p>
<p>At the end of October Telus released the 2.1 upgrade for the Hero and I downloaded it over-the-air so I could get tethering again.</p>
<p>First incoming phone call? The Hero rebooted!</p>
<p>I'm wondering why my Desire was sent back to HTC when clearly the problem is somewhere in the Telus build of Android 2.1.</p>
