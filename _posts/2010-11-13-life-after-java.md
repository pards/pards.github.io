There has been a lot of talk lately that Java is on its way out, mostly fueled
by [Apple deprecatingJava](http://weblogs.java.net/blog/fabriziogiudici/archive/2010/10/21/apple-possibly-deprecated-java-community-nice-test-you), and by 
[Apache threateningto quit Java](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/11/10/apache_to_quit_jcp/).

I'm not crying Chicken Little just yet, but perhaps it's time to start looking
for the Next Big Thing.  There are certainly a lot of contenders out there:
Ruby (and Rails), Scala, Groovy (and Grails).  My guess is there'll be a
couple of false starts before a clear winner is declared.

This all feels very similar to the late-90s when C/C++ were waning in
popularity.  Back then it was all about time-to-market and code complexity.
So it is once again with Java.
