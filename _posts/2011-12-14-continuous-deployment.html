<p>Automation isn't about quality, it's about scale.  Manual processes don't scale.</p>
<p>Each part of your process that you automate gets you one step closer to continuous deployment. For many teams, automation is a Quadrant 4 activity - not urgent, not important - but on my teams it is a Quadrant 2 activity - important but not urgent. We allocate time each iteration to improve our automation because it frees up more time for development.</p>
<p>Things we automate include</p>
<ul>
<li>Build (Jenkins)</li>
<li>Testing (JUnit, Selenium)</li>
<li>Deployment (ControlTier)</li>
</ul>
<p>On a typical project the deployment is the last part to be automated, however on my current project we've strived to automate our deployment since Day One simply because we're deploying to a grid with many moving parts.  Automation allows us to scale our deployment without taking time away from our development activities.</p>
<p>Automated processes also serve as executable documentation.  The precise steps to perform a function are documented in code and are repeatable.  The only way the process can change is if the automation that controls it also changes, so the documentation is always up-to-date. Computers don't forget to do things the way that IT Operations staff do.</p>
<p>Our deployment works. Repeatedly. Because it's automated.</p>
