<p>Today is my last day at CIBC and that makes me sad.  It's been an honour and a privilege to work with <a href="http://ca.linkedin.com/pub/michael-salvagna/0/a26/a8a">Mike Salvagna</a> and his fantastic development team for the last 18 months.  Mike has assembled one of the best development teams in Toronto that, in his words, "can build anything". I believe he's right.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I start at <a href="http://intelliware.com">Intelliware</a> where I'll be leading another FX project.  I'm looking forward to the challenges that this new position will bring, but I can't help feeling down about leaving behind such a great team at CIBC.</p>
