<p>I've recently started using <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/">Mercurial</a>, which is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_revision_control">distributed version control system</a>.  </p>
<p>DVCSs initially struck me as a solution looking for a problem.  SubVersion seemed good enough for our purposes at work, but we decided to try out Mercurial for one iteration to see what all the fuss was about.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most significant difference between SubVersion and Mercurial is that Mercurial uses a local repository.  This subtle distinction significantly changes how you work because you can commit your changes without having to publish them.  A 'commit' in Mercurial is like a savepoint in database-speak - it gives you a safe place to roll back to if things go awry.  Once you're happy with your changes you can use the patch queue to fold all your commits into a single changeset and 'push' (i.e. publish) your changes to the central repository.</p>
<p>With Mercurial I commit early and commit often.</p>
