<p>The TestNG Eclipse plugin has a feature that will convert your unit tests from JUnit to TestNG in a few simple clicks, and it works pretty well for the most part.  However, I soon noticed that it was replacing Assert.assertX with AssertJUnit.assertX.  Upon further inspection, this was because TestNG's Assert uses different argument ordering.  For example<br />
[java]<br />
  // JUnit<br />
  Assert.assertEquals(message, expected, actual);</p>
<p>  // TestNG<br />
  Assert.assertEquals(actual, expected, message);<br />
[/java]</p>
<p>Each argument has moved.</p>
<p>For most people, sticking with AssertJUnit will be good enough, but we wanted to go all-in on TestNG so I set about trying to figure out the best way to safely refactor our tests.</p>
<p>First, I did a global search-and-replace in Eclipse to change AssertJUnit to Assert.  This produced a bunch of compilation errors and failing tests caused by assertEquals(msg, string, string) that I fixed by hand.  But I still had the problem of getting incorrect failure messages like "found X, expected Y" when it should have been "found Y, expected X".</p>
<p>Automating the transposition of the expected/actual arguments was the hard part.  My first instinct was to use regular expressions as explained <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7718338/using-eclipse-find-and-replace-all-to-swap-arguments">here on StackOverflow</a> until I realised that it doesn't handle the more complex cases like Assert.assertEquals("a", methodCall(a,b));</p>
<p>Then I recalled that Eclipse has a great feature to support changing the signature of a method. Just right-click on the method name, choose "Refactor" then "Change Method Signature..." and you'll be presented with a dialog box that allows you to alter any aspect of the method.  </p>
<p>But the method in question is in an API, not my code.</p>
<p>The trick here was to <em>create a local copy of the org.testng.Assert</em> class in my project.  Maven and Eclipse will find my copy instead of the TestNG copy because it appears first on the classpath. Next, I opened up my copy of org.testng.Assert and used Eclipse's nifty refactoring tools to swap the expected/actual arguments. This automatically (and accurately) flipped the argument order in my test cases.  Once it was done I simply deleted my local copy of org.testng.Assert.</p>
