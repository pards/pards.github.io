<p>When there's a merge conflict in Mercurial, TortoiseHG will give you the option to 'take local' or 'take other' in addition to resolving the conflict.</p>
<p>However, sometimes you may want to 'take local' or 'take other'  when there's <i>no</i> merge conflict.</p>
<p>To take local:<br />
[code]<br />
hg merge --tool internal:local &lt;rev&gt;<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>To take other:<br />
[code]<br />
hg merge --tool internal:other &lt;rev&gt;<br />
[/code]</p>
