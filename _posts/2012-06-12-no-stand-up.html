<p>There was no stand-up this morning and it felt like my day never really started.  It was my first day at my new job with CIBC and, even though I knew that the team was not agile before signing up for the gig, I had underestimated how much I depended upon our daily <del datetime="2012-06-12T11:06:59+00:00">rituals</del> practices at Intelliware.  These practices provided a rhythm and cadence to the day that I had taken for granted.</p>
