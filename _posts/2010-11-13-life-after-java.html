<p>There has been a lot of talk lately that Java is on its way out, mostly fueled by<a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/fabriziogiudici/archive/2010/10/21/apple-possibly-deprecated-java-community-nice-test-you"> Apple deprecating Java</a>, and by <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/11/10/apache_to_quit_jcp/">Apache threatening to quit Java</a>.</p>
<p><!--more-->I'm not crying Chicken Little just yet, but perhaps it's time to start looking for the Next Big Thing.  There are certainly a lot of contenders out there: Ruby (and Rails), Scala, Groovy (and Grails).  My guess is there'll be a couple of false starts before a clear winner is declared.</p>
<p>This all feels very similar to the late-90s when C/C++ were waning in popularity.  Back then it was all about time-to-market and code complexity.  So it is once again with Java.</p>
