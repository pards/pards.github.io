<p>This week I encountered an interesting issue in Tapestry when I tried to dynamically load a component using Tapestry's built-in EventListener functionality.  The component in question had a <code>.script</code> file associated with it, which Tapestry loaded dynamically, but the JavaScript functions in the <code>.script</code> file were "not found" when I tried to execute them.</p>
<p>After a bit of digging around, a colleague of mine noticed that Tapestry was loading the <code>.script</code> file using an <code>eval()</code> statement instead of inserting the script into the DOM.</p>
<p>In order for the JavaScript functions to be usable we had to change the script file to save anonymous functions into variable names.</p>
<p>Before:<br />
<code>function someFunctionName() {<br />
   ...;<br />
}</code></p>
<p>After:<br />
<code>someFunctionName = function() {<br />
   ...;<br />
}</code></p>
