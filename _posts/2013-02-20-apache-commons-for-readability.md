There are many short methods in the [Apache
Commons](http://commons.apache.org/lang/api-release/index.html) libraries that
seem like overkill at first glance, however, their purpose becomes more
apparent when you examine the effect that these methods have on the
readability of the caller.

I see a lot of code that does stuff like this:  
[java]  
if( s == null || "".equals(s.trim()))  
{  
// Do something  
}  
[/java]  
which could be re-written as  
[java]  
if( StringUtils.isBlank(s))  
{  
// Do something  
}  
[/java]  
Personally, I find it much easier to understand the intent of the second
version.

Same goes for [the admittedly poorly named] 'defaultString'  
[java]  
String result = s1;  
if( s1 == null)  
{  
result = s2;  
}  
[/java]  
which could be re-written as  
[java]  
String result = StringUtils.defaultString(s1, s2);  
[/java]

There's no need to re-invent the wheel. Many smart people have worked hard to
write these methods in an efficient, bug-free way so you might as well
leverage all their hard work.

By using the tried-and-true Apache Commons classes where possible your code
will be more readable and its intended behaviour will be clearer.
