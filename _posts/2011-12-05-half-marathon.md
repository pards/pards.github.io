On December 4, three weeks after getting hit by a car, I ran the Las Vegas
half-marathon in 1:44:11.

I was very nervous about how my shoulder would hold up, but it was ok. Â I had
to run with my left elbow held tightly against my ribs to limit movement in
the AC joint, and as soon as the race was over I headed to the medical tent
for an ice pack to prevent excessive swelling.

The race probably set my recovery back a week or two but I am really glad I
was able to complete the race - I don't think I sustained any permanent injury
from it.

Now, onto the shoulder rehabilitation.
