<p>There are many short methods in the <a href="http://commons.apache.org/lang/api-release/index.html">Apache Commons</a> libraries that seem like overkill at first glance, however, their purpose becomes more apparent when you examine the effect that these methods have on the readability of the caller.</p>
<p>I see a lot of code that does stuff like this:<br />
[java]<br />
if( s == null || &quot;&quot;.equals(s.trim()))<br />
{<br />
	// Do something<br />
}<br />
[/java]<br />
which could be re-written as<br />
[java]<br />
if( StringUtils.isBlank(s))<br />
{<br />
	// Do something<br />
}<br />
[/java]<br />
Personally, I find it much easier to understand the intent of the second version.</p>
<p>Same goes for [the admittedly poorly named] 'defaultString'<br />
[java]<br />
String result = s1;<br />
if( s1 == null)<br />
{<br />
	result = s2;<br />
}<br />
[/java]<br />
which could be re-written as<br />
[java]<br />
String result = StringUtils.defaultString(s1, s2);<br />
[/java]</p>
<p>There's no need to re-invent the wheel.  Many smart people have worked hard to write these methods in an efficient, bug-free way so you might as well leverage all their hard work. </p>
<p>By using the tried-and-true Apache Commons classes where possible your code will be more readable and its intended behaviour will be clearer.</p>
