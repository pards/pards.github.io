This is a continuation of my post about [clean tea](/2016/09/clean-tea), except this time I analysed the offerings from [Tealyra](http://www.tealyra.ca).

Tealyra by the numbers:

* 490 teas (excluding kits and samplers)
* 175 contain sugar and/or flavourings
* 187 caffeine-free

So I filtered the list to only show teas with:

* No caffeine
* No sugar
* No stevia
* No flavourings

86 teas on the TealyraÂ® menu pass my filter for what I would consider to be "clean" which makes Tealyra the best of the three that I've looked at so far.  Overall the offerings from Tealyra are pretty decent once you filter out the ones with sweeteners and/or flavourings however I felt overwhelmed by the sheer number of options.

I've ordered from the Tealyra website quite a few times now, and can recommend the following items

 * [Blood cleanser](https://www.tealyra.ca/tea-collections/detox-tea/blood-cleanser-chai-686/)
 * [911 detox](https://www.tealyra.ca/tea-collections/detox-tea/911-detox/)
