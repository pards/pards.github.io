<p>According to the <a hrf="http://www.hauppauge.com/wd/">Hauppauge</a> website, the Western Digital Live Hub works with the Hauppauge WinTV-HVR-950Q TV tuner.</p>
<p>It does not.</p>
<p>The Hauppauge app does the channel scan, but freezes when you try to change channels.  In other words you have to reboot the WD Live box whenever you want to change channels.  That doesn't count as working in my books. Just sayin'...</p>
<p>A bit of Googling has shown that 950Q hardware Rev B may have worked, but the version commonly available in stores is Rev E. YMMV.</p>
