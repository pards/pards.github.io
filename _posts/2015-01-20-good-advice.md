A thread appeared on Hacker News recently about how successful people operate.  [The comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8917667) below really struck a chord with me.

> * Don't waste time. 
> * Be mission/vision focused. 
> * Be polite to everyone always. 
> * Be helpful whenever possible. 
> * Be insanely organized. 
> * Seek and respond to constructive feedback on your work. 
> * Do the shit work without whining.

This excellent advice would make a person extremely valuable to an employer.  You want your name to be the first thing that springs to mind when someone is putting together a team to tackle a project. Just like in Pulp Fiction when Jules learns that Marsellus is ["sending The Wolf"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzNvicZWZ_A).
