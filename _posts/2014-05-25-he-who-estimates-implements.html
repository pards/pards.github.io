<blockquote>I've been over the high-level requirements and think it'll probably take 8 weeks with 2 developers, so you should be able to deliver this by X.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, that's great. Can I presume that you're one of the two developers working on it? I didn't think so.</p>
<p>Nothing irks me more than being handed a batch of work along with the timeline for delivering it. If you want to estimate my work for me, then you can also go ahead and build it.</p>
<p>To be clear, I'm not talking about Planning Estimates, I'm talking about hard deadlines. I use Planning Estimates to attach a high-level cost to a feature which helps customers prioritize the work.  However, once the work is scheduled the actual developers building the feature re-estimate it in detail and this is communicated to the customer along with the expected delivery date.</p>
<p>The variables for any given chunk of work are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scope</li>
<li>Resources</li>
<li>Timeline</li>
</ul>
<p>You can only control 2 of these.</p>
<p>Tell me what to build. I'll tell you how much effort it'll take. You can adjust the timeline by either reducing scope or adding people (up to a point. 9 women can't have a baby in 1 month).</p>
<p>Just don't try to control all three.</p>
