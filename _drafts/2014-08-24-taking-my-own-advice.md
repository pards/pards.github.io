> What are you going to do? Curse the darkness, or light a candle?

I was having a casual, after-dinner conversation with my father-in-law last night when the subject turned to work and I mentioned that I wasn't particularly happy on my current project.  He said something along the lines of, "You  know, Craig, this is a cyclical phenomonen - your contentedness is tied to your project.  I think you either need to be happy as a contractor, or figure out how to get some equity."

It was sage advice.

This isn't the first time we've had this conversation and it made me realise that even though I've been advocating that people either make a change or stop complaining, but I haven't been taking my own advice.

I love being a consultant.  I get to work on a wide variety of project; I get to meet new and interesting people; and I get exposed to many different aspects of business.  However, as my father-in-law eloquently noted, I do not have a stake beyond the project (other than my reputation). I don't get a share of the profits that a project generates, I don't get stock options, or a big bonus, or a step up the corporate ladder. I just get another project.  Without such long-term rewards the only thing that matters is the project.

So. What are my options?

1. Take a full-time, corporate job.
2. Build a product.
3. Start a consultancy.

The first option isn't particularly appealing because I'm already half-way through so I wouldn't have the career runway to build a significant stake in the company by the time I retired.  It would also result in a significant dip in income for a few years until I reached an executive level.  That would present issues because I'm the sole provider for my family.

Building a product is The Dream. You toil away at something you care deeply about, people understand your vision and customers come flooding in. Or not, and you go broke and go back to whatever you were doing before. The huge upside is that once a product is off the ground it makes money while you're sleeping, decoupling your income from your time which is the scourge of consulting. As an added bonus, you have the option of selling the company to a larger organisation and retiring or starting the process again.

Starting a consultancy is the low-risk option.  It's a business that I know and understand.  I already have a reasonable list of contacts, and the income starts as soon as the first client pays their first invoice.  The downside is that it's a very cyclical business, and it's not a business that lends itself to a future sale.

My biggest fear is starting.

There's a billion quotes out there that all say the same thing: You can only win if you're in the race.
