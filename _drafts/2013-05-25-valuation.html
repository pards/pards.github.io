<p>I've been thinking a little bit lately about how the job market works, and how rates get set (and agreed upon).</p>
<p>The hardest part of landing a new gig is being able to convince the potential client that you're worth what you're charging.  This is where referrals help a lot - having someone on the other side of the table that can vouch for your work makes a huge difference, because often an interviewer will throw a logic puzzle your way and if you don't nail it then you're out.</p>
<p>While I don't agree with logic puzzles as an interviewing technique, I don't have any issues working on them when I'm the candidate.  However, give a good candidate the wrong question and you may miss an opportunity.</p>
<p>Anyway, on to the point of this post.  I don't like having my valuation set by a third party that only spent 45 minutes with me.  It may seem arrogant, but I know what I'm worth and often I struggle to convince a potential client of the same.</p>
<p>This got me thinking that maybe "working for the man" isn't for me.  If I want to earn what I think I'm worth then the only real way to do that is to go solo and build something for myself and see if I can get it to generate more income than my day job.  Of course, if I pulled that off then I wouldn't need to convince a client to pay me - I'd be kicking back in The Bahamas.</p>
