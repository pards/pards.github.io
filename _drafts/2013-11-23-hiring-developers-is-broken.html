<p>Each time I'm involved in hiring, or being hired, I get this nagging feeling that <em>it shouldn't be this hard</em>.</p>
<p>As an employer, finding the right candidates is challenging to say the least.  I've interviewed people for senior developer roles that I'm convinced have never written a line of code in their life, and yet their resume was strong, and they got through the HR phone screening.  How is that possible?  And then there's the topic of "fit" that adds a very subjective dimension to hiring.</p>
<p>As a candidate, navigating the job-spam from recruitment agencies becomes a full-time job in itself.  The job specifications all look the same and rarely provide me any of the information I need to determine whether it's a <em>good</em> job.  I often get called repeatedly by different recruiters about the same job, and I've even had calls about roles that my team advertised for!  I can't exactly interview myself now, can I?</p>
<p>Hiring developers is broken.</p>
<p>Great, but we need solutions not problems, so how do we fix it?  If I knew the answer to that, I'd be a rich man.</p>
<p>Job sites like <a href="http://moster.ca">Monster"</a> and <a href="http://workopolis.com">Workopolis</a> were supposed to fix this by providing companies with direct access to candidates and eliminating the middle man, but before long the only jobs being posted on those sites were from the middle men themselves - recruitment agencies.</p>
<p>Same goes for <a href="http://linkedin.com">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
<p>The only conclusion I can draw from that is that companies <em>don't want</em> direct access to candidates. They quite like outsourcing the arduous task of shortlisting.</p>
<p>Companies like <a href="http://grouptalent.com">GroupTalent</a> are trying to address this problem by allowing companies and candidates to "date" each other through short-term contract before moving ahead with the hiring process.</p>
