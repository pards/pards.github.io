<p>I recently watched "Who killed the electric car" and it struck me that the internal combustion engine is a design problem - it tightly couples the fuel source with the consumer.  There's no dependency injection opportunity here.</p>
<p>Electricity is like an interface - it can be produced by coal, solar, wind, or nuclear sources.</p>
