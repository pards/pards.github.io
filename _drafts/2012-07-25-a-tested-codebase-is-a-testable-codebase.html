<p>I found that it was just too hard to write unit tests for my code. I was able to achieve good test coverage on the easy-to-test methods, and almost zero on the important, complex methods. </p>
<p>Eventually I'd say "Fuck it", and just write the code that I needed to write.  Broken windows are hard to fix when there's half a million lines of code and almost no unit tests.</p>
<p>And then I got a job at Intelliware and saw what a testable codebase looked like.  From the beginning, the code was built with unit tests.</p>
<p>Now, I find myself back in an untested codebase and I'm realising that it wasn't my inexperience that made unit testing difficult in the past - it's the codebase.  The difference now is that I know the patterns that I need to refactor towards in order to facilitate unit testing.</p>
