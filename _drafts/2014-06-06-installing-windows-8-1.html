<p>I have a laptop that runs Linux but I needed Windows so I could run my accounting software, so I decided to buy a copy of Windows 8.1 and run it as a Virtual Machine in <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a></p>
<p>The experience of buying software from Microsoft was appalling.<br />
<!-- more --><br />
I went to microsoft.com, chose Products, then Windows 8.1. There's no "buy" button on this page, so I took a guess and went to the Downloads page and found the Buy Windows 8.1 button. I clicked.</p>
<p>Inexplicably, there's no Add To Cart on the next page, just an Upgrade Now button. But I'm not upgrading; I'm on Linux. I want to download an ISO file so I can install it as a Virtual Machine.</p>
<p>I try Google. No dice. After a frustrating series of searches including "buy windows 8", I finally stumbled upon the Microsoft store website which is different from microsoft.com.  Here I was able to find Windows 8.1, add it to my cart and head for the checkout.</p>
<p>But then it logged me out. Repeatedly. So I initiated a live chat with a support person who advised me that it only works with Internet Explorer. Wow, really? But that doesn't run on Linux.</p>
<p>So, I dust off my old Windows XP laptop and repeat the whole process. I am finally able to checkout and pay for the product, but the confirmation page doesn't have a download link. And there's no email. What did I just pay for?</p>
<p>Live chat again. I'm told that I'll receive an email in the next 4 hours once the payment has cleared. Again ... wow. Anyway, the email arrived about 10 minutes later and I click on the download link.</p>
<p>It's not an ISO file; it's an EXE. Not so good for a Linux machine.  The support guy directs me to <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media">this article</a> that explains how to create an ISO file from the EXE.</p>
<p>I double-click on the EXE file and am promptly informed that I cannot install from Windows XP. It has to be run on Windows 7. But I don't want to <em>install it</em> on the machine I'm on, I want to create an ISO file to use on my Linux machine.</p>
<p>I'm feeling pretty satisfied at this point. It's been such a pleasure.</p>
<p>So I locate a Windows 7 machine, copy the executable file (which, incidentally, I now want to execute in the firing squad kind of way), and fire it up. I step through the wizard and the download begins.</p>
<p>Cue the Jeopardy tune, and 2 hours later .... the download completes, checks itself (2 mins), gets the files ready (10 mins), and finally create the ISO (3 mins). I copy the ISO to a USB, copy it over to the Linux machine and <em>finally</em> I'm ready to install Windows 8.</p>
<p>The VirtualBox setup goes without a hitch.</p>
<p>As a software developer I cannot condone software piracy. But seriously, I could have downloaded an illegal - but fully-functional - copy of Windows 8 in less than an hour via BitTorrent. The process of doing it legally cost me over 5 hours. Five Hours!!</p>
<p>I had to work really, really hard to do The Right Thing in this case, but many people would not have had the perseverance to endure this soul-destroying process. It has made me bitter. I never want to give another penny to Microsoft. </p>
<p>I should have ditched QuickBooks and migrated over to <a href="http://www.xero.com/">Xero</a>.</p>
