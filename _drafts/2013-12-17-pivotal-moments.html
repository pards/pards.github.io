<p>There are only a handful of moments in a person's life where pivotal decisions are made, decisions that shape the future for several years to come. Those moments are easily recognizable after the fact as you look back on your life and reflect on how you got to where you are.</p>
<p>I think I'm about to have one of those days today.</p>
<p>It is a rare gift that I can recognize it <em>before</em> it happens.  I find myself at a critical junction in my career where I either choose to stay the course or seize the opportunity that has been presented. I'm inclined to choose the latter given how much it scares the shit out of me even though it means that I must have several critical conversations today.</p>
<p>The peacemaker inside me wants to complete this transition without upsetting the other parties involved and I hope that I can do that, but I doubt that everyone will be entirely happy.</p>
<p>Perhaps I'll look back fondly on this day in a few years, or perhaps it'll be recalled with disappointment.  Either way, I know that it will be without regret if I face it head-on.</p>
