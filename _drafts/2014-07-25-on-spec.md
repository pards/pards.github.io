I love working against a well-written specification. It tells me exactly what I need to build, everything is expressed clearly, and I can just go heads-down and build it. I even have a template for the tests I need to write.

But working from a spec doesn't absolve me of the responsiblity to think.

A specification is a leaky abstraction.  It is the manifestation of somebody's understanding of the problem loosely translated in to English, but English isn't as precise as programming languages. And some of the knowledge acquired by the author of the spec may have been omitted from the spec itself, having been deemed irrelevant or minutae.  For example, if a particular rule was derived by examining some data then the rule may be expressed in words, but the SQL used in the investigation probably won't make the cut even though it is more expressive than the English translation.

And that's what sorts the senior developers from the others. They'll ask for the SQL, or confirm their interpretation of the English, instead of hiding behind a blanket "I built what was in the spec".
