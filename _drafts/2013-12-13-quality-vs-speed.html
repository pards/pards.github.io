<p>I refer to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6899669">this piece</a> posted by <a href="https://twitter.com/jamesshore">James Shore</a>.</p>
<p>What matters more, code quality or quick delivery?</p>
<p>I agree with James that what matters depends on who you ask.  I have seen many software projects achieve great things in very short periods of time and hailed as huge success stories only to get re-written a few years later.</p>
<p>The investment banking and capital markets environments are notorious for this.  Many banks claim that time-to-market is their competitive advantage and that they can't afford to invest in things such as automated tests and deployments.</p>
<p>But if the software is so important, then can you really afford to throw it all away in a few years' time to re-write it, all the while losing market share to your competitors?</p>
